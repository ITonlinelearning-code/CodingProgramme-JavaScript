# Dark and Light Mode Web Application

## Project Description
This web application demonstrates how to switch between dark and light modes using JavaScript. The project includes a simple user interface with a toggle button that allows users to switch between modes.

## Features
- Light mode and dark mode styles
- Smooth transition between modes
- Dynamic updating of button text to indicate the current mode

## Files
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and content of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles for both light and dark modes.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for DOM manipulation and mode toggling.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and its features.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.

## JavaScript Code Explanation
- The `toggleButton` variable selects the toggle button element.
- The `toggleMode` function toggles the `dark-mode` class on the `body`, `header`, and `button` elements, and updates the button text to reflect the current mode.
- An event listener is added to the toggle button to call the `toggleMode` function when the button is clicked.
